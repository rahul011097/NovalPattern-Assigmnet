Design Choise For UI and UX :-
1.Simplicity:- The user interface (UI) is designed with simplicity in mind.Complex and overly ornate designs can overwhelm users, so I have opted for a straightforward and elegant approach. 2. User-Centered Approach: The user experience (UX) decisions are driven by a user-centered approach. The primary goal is to ensure that the website is intuitive and user-friendly. 3. Consistency: Consistency in design elements, such as color schemes, typography, and navigation, is crucial for a smooth user experience. 4. Responsive Design: In today's multi-device world, it's essential to ensure the UI adapts to different screen sizes and orientations. The design is responsive, providing an optimal experience on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
